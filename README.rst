About
-----


All successful Earth observation applications have different components:

- policy mandates;
- national priorities;
- satellite and in situ observations;
- collaborators;
- methods and algorithms;
- and deployment strategies.


**GEO Knowledge Hub** is an open-source digital library designed to serve the community and to ensure that all these components are visible, accessible, and that others can share their knowledge and experience in a codified manner for country-relevant, evidence-based decision-making in order to allow this knowledge to be reproduced. It will allow to advance reproducibility of the knowledge produced by the `GEO community <https://www.earthobservations.org/index.php>`_ (Flagships, Initiatives and Community activities of the `GEO Work Programme <https://www.earthobservations.org/geoss_wp.php>`_).


Powered by InvenioRDM
